My name is Erick, I am a systems engineer, I have studies of an [MBA - USMP](http://www.administracion.usmp.edu.pe/postgrado/maestrias/maestria-en-administracion-de-negocios-mba/) and a [master's degree in TIG  UNFV](http://www.unfv.edu.pe/eupg/index.php/maestrias/ingenieria-arquitectura-y-ciencias-basicas/tecnologia-de-informacion-geografica). Have been working in the government of my country, in some entities that handle multipurpose cadastre such as MTC, MIDAGRI and also the private sector. My research interests include geographic information science (GIS), remote sensing, and machine learning (deep learning). I like to program and teach how to create maps and in my spare time I try to support some OpenSource projects such as  [OpenUBL](https://project-openubl.github.io/community/team/) and others.
